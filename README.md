# 🌊 ECHOSHIFT: The Abyssal Breach

**Theme:** *Beneath the Surface*

## 🛰️ Project Vision
`ECHOSHIFT` is a tactical deep-sea survival game where the world is hidden in total darkness. You control a high-tech salvage drone navigating the "Great Trench." To see, you must pulse high-frequency sonar waves that reveal the environment as glowing wireframe echoes.

## 🕹️ Core Gameplay
1. **Pulse to See:** Press `SPACE` to send a sonar ping. The environment is briefly revealed in neon outlines.
2. **Resource Management:** Every ping costs **Battery**. Moving costs **Oxygen**.
3. **The Hunters:** Beneath the surface, there are creatures that can't see but track your sound. Every ping you send is a beacon for them.
4. **Objective:** Descend into the breach, recover the "Origin Core," and reach the extraction rig.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Framework:** React + Vite
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (High-tech HUD)
- **Engine:** Custom HTML5 Canvas (Optimized for wave physics)
- **Logic:** TypeScript
